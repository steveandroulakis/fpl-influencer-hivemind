"""
FPL data analysis scripts following script-first development approach.

This package contains standalone scripts for Fantasy Premier League data analysis:
- get_team_players.py: List players by Premier League club
- get_top_ownership.py: Top players by ownership percentage
- get_current_gameweek.py: Current gameweek information

Each script can run independently using PEP 723 inline metadata or
after installing shared dependencies from the root pyproject.toml.

These utilities are designed for eventual migration to:
src/fpl_influencer_hivemind/fpl_tools/
