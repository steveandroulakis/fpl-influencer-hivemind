TRANSCRIPT:
[Music] What is going on everyone? My name is Andy. Welcome back to another FPL video. In this one, it&#39;s my team selection for gameweek three. So, I&#39;m going to take you through how the team is looking, thoughts on transfers, of which I have many, especially if Palmer misses gameweek three, and why Palmer being out might unlock bench boost in gameweek five for me. And I&#39;ll show you how I did in gameweek 2. Spoiler alert, not great. There is reasons to feel better than I did after gameweek one, which I&#39;ll talk through as well. So, let&#39;s get into it. So, gameweek two, what a week for all the wrong reasons. What&#39;s that saying? If you don&#39;t laugh, you&#39;ll cry. That&#39;s how I feel about my FPL team right now. Gameweek one, 46 points. Not a great start, but you&#39;re going to get those kind of gameweeks over the season. So, you just write it off. It&#39;s frustrating that it&#39;s happening the first week, but hopefully things will get better. Spoiler alert, they didn&#39;t. I followed up 46 points with 43 in gameweek 2 and a red arrow down to 7.5 million. Absolute nightmare start for me. And the weekend overall, apart from Saturday, was just really frustrating. But weirdly, I feel better after gameweek two than I did after gameweek one. And I&#39;ll explain why in a second. But in terms of the frustration, I switch captaincy on a deadline stream to Cole Palmer. Chelsea go and score five goals against West Ham. He&#39;s not in the squad whatsoever. And I get it right. He might have played and got no points, but he probably would have walked away with something. and losing one of your premium players for a game like that is just not ideal. So, Friday wasn&#39;t great for me apart from the fact that Sanchez conceded. Saturday was a little bit better because Pedro Porr got a clean sheet and five points. So, he came off the bench for Cole Palmer and also Spurs getting that clean sheet not only meant points for me, but it also meant that Harland and Rinders with fairly high ownership had also blanked and I got my double Bernie clean sheet. So although Watkins and Strand Arson blanked on Saturday, overall I felt a little bit better and I was going into Sunday and Monday with like six players but I basically got no points from them. Salah got an assist fair enough vice captain but Anderson four-point with the defensive contributions. Nico Williams two, Verts two against Newcastle look pretty anom anonymous for that game. Liverpool just pretty awful really. I know they won but they were pretty bad considering Newcastle were down to 10 men for so much of that game. Jewsbury Hall two-pointer and of course Bruno Fernandez missed the penalty and when he stepped up to take it I thought there&#39;s a good chance he&#39;s going to score but once that stuff started happening with the referee and he just didn&#39;t seem to refocus I I just had this sinking feeling that he was going to miss and it&#39;s fine margins like that in FPL that can have such a big impact on the points you score I&#39;m on 43 Fernandez scores that he&#39;s on a 12 13 pointer all of a sudden he looks like a better pick on same points as Harland and I&#39;ve got over 50 points and things feel better but instead he missed. So apart from the salah assist I basically got nothing apart from defensive contribution from Anderson after Saturday. So I felt okay on Saturday but then six players to come and it was just terrible after that. Why do I feel better after game week two though? I think in terms of the overreaction from gameweek one. I didn&#39;t get caught up in that. I rolled my transfer and now if Palm is out I&#39;m in a much better position to deal with that. If you think about the players people brought in after gameweek one like Harland scored twice against Wolves, there was this massive panic. You had to get him in. He&#39;s blanked against Spurs. The new Lionel Messi aka Tajani Rinders. You know, if you joined me on that Sunday kneejerk stream, it was like you had to bring him in at all costs. No matter whether it was for a hit or a free transfer, no matter which player you had to sell, you had to get Rinders in. He blanked as well. And that&#39;s not me rewriting history. He was a good pick. He&#39;s still really good value. I might get him in this week. But the idea that he had to come in in gameweek two, I just didn&#39;t agree with. Semeno people knee-jerkked in. That&#39;s a good pick to be fair. And he did walk away with an assist. But you know, people were transferring in Sunderland defenders after their 17 pointer. People with Xiao Pedro switched to Chris Wood and now the opposites happened in game week two. Xiao Pedro&#39;s walked away with 15 points and Chris Wood has blanked. So although my week wasn&#39;t very good in terms of how I played it, I feel okay about it cuz I&#39;m now walking into gameweek three with two free transfers. And when I look down the list of players that have scored points so far, there are some good picks on this list, but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve made massive mistakes. Like Calorie and Timber are the top two scoring defenders and Ballard makes up the top three. I never considered them for a single second, so I&#39;m not going to beat myself up over not having them. Celiba, fair enough. Arsenal defense is great. That can always happen. Chaloba, fair enough. Not many people looking at him. Kukare was a good pick. Their midfielder Semeno&#39;s good, but then you&#39;ve got like Cullen from Burnley, Brennan Johnson from Spurs. If they sign another winger, his minutes might go right down. Indoori from Forest, Anthony from Bernie, Tavir from Bournemouth. These are not players that I think I&#39;m going to be particularly worried about long term. Gak Poe is third on the list. Fair enough. Maybe I&#39;ve made a mistake with Vertz, but there&#39;s a world where Vertz gets a couple of points in the first two and Gapo doesn&#39;t. like the assist for the first goal for Graen Burch&#39;s goal against Newcastle. That&#39;s just like a meter pass from Gapire. And and I&#39;m not saying he shouldn&#39;t get that. That&#39;s how FPL works. But, you know, you don&#39;t continue to get those assists. And I look at like the forwards as well like Echitique, fair enough. I got the minutes wrong there. Xiao Pedro really good against West Ham. Let&#39;s see if he does well in game week three. People were panicking about him after one game week. And Richardson is the third highest scorer. So, I don&#39;t look at that and think I made loads of massive mistakes. I know people will look at my team and say it&#39;s terrible. I&#39;ve had messages saying I&#39;ve not got one good player in my team and stuff. I just think that&#39;s absolute nonsense. It&#39;s just I&#39;ve had a couple of bad game weeks, but in terms of how I played it after gameweek one, despite scoring fewer points, I actually feel better going into gameweek three. So, let&#39;s talk about it. So, I&#39;ve got two free transfers this week and nothing in the bank. In fact, my squad value has dropped to 99.9 million. That&#39;s cuz verts went down from 8.5 to 8.4 million and none of my players have gone up in price yet. But I&#39;m not going to panic about that for now. Defensively, I think things look pretty good. So, I&#39;ve got Sanchez in goal for Chelsea against Fulham at home. Good chance of a clean sheet there. Agedu against Everton at home. I don&#39;t really trust the Wolves defense, but on paper it&#39;s not a bad fixture, and he&#39;s pretty good for defensive contributions as well. He finished in gameweek two on a four-pointer. I think Everton have made some good signings, Juh Hall, Dibling, uh, Greish, etc. So, they might be a bit more attacking this season, but it&#39;s still a pretty good fixture on paper. So Abuadoo, no issues with him. Pedro parr looks good. Spurs defense should be a bit better this season under Frank. Bournemouth at home not easy. We know Bournemouth attack is decent, but he&#39;s got attacking potential in his locker as well. So there&#39;s not really a massive need to move him on. And I think if I was going to go to someone like Munos, I&#39;ve missed the boat on doing that. If I was going to buy him, it was last week. So instead, now the window to buy him is gameweek four before Sunderland at home. So par definitely stays. and Nico Williams. Annoyingly, Forest don&#39;t have a clean sheet yet, but if they&#39;re going to pick up their first one of the season, it&#39;s probably against West Ham at home. That just looks like such a good fixture right now. And I wouldn&#39;t put it past fork or Bowen scoring in this game, but obviously Nico Williams is not bad enough to transfer out. So, I&#39;m just going to play that back three. And then on the bench, Dravka against Man United away, Anderson against Chelsea away, and Estv against Man United as well. So, defensively, really easy benching decisions this week and no transfers needed. So, with my midfield, there&#39;s a lot more to talk about. Vertz hasn&#39;t started the season well. It&#39;s Arsenal at home this week. He&#39;s already dropped in price once. If he blanks again, he&#39;ll probably drop in price over the international break. Cole Palmer&#39;s yellow flagged. Might miss gameweek three. If he does, do I sell him? Keep him. If I sell him, who for? I&#39;ll come on to all that in a second. Let me get the easy players out of the way first. Salah staying there&#39;s no obviously need to use a transfer on him. He&#39;s my vice captain for Arsenal at home. and in game week four against Burnley away and game week five against Everton at home, he&#39;ll be my captain for those weeks. So, he stays. Jubury Hall is just an enabler in my team. If I have to play him, so be it. I&#39;ve said before I wish that was Rinders instead, but it&#39;s not a massive deal. If I&#39;ve got to play Jubury Hall against Wolves away, I&#39;m okay with that. And if I do end up selling Palmer, which I will come on to in a second, then Jubury Hall will probably become my eighth attacker. So having a 5 million midfielder on the bench or having to play with pretty good fixtures at the moment is not a huge issue that I see. Bruno Fernandez, there is no way I will sell him this week. No matter how the first two game weeks have gone, it&#39;s Bernie at home. That would be crazy to do. At the moment, he&#39;s my captain. That was always the intention when I built this team in gameweek one. So you remember last week I spoke about my intention was to play Dravka and EsteeV double up. I don&#39;t like changing my mind on things I&#39;ve decided, you know, previously unless there&#39;s something that should massively change my mind. And Man United did lose to Grimby last night in the cup, which is not great. But it&#39;s still burning at home on paper. It&#39;s a great fixture. And if I&#39;m going to go against salary in my team, this is the week to do it. So, I&#39;m pretty confident Fernandez will be my captain by the time we get to the deadline. Is it going to go well? A 9 million pound player playing in central midfield as captain? Maybe not. But I think I&#39;ve got to see it through. With Verts, if Palmer&#39;s out, there&#39;s no justification for selling Verts instead. I don&#39;t think. And part of the reason I think that is because in game week four, it&#39;s Burnley away, and then five is Everton at home. So, it&#39;s not like he has terrible fixtures to come. If it was Arsenal at home this week, followed up by Man City away, Chelsea at home, then I&#39;d probably sell him. In fact, I probably wouldn&#39;t have started the season with him, to be honest. But he&#39;s got good fixtures to come. So, I don&#39;t think I can justify selling him if Palmer&#39;s out. If Palmer&#39;s fit, then maybe there is a case to be made to sell verts. But I still think I would rather value holding the transfer. So if Palmer&#39;s fit, I&#39;d rather roll and go into gameweek four after the international break, after the transfer window shuts with three free transfers. And I&#39;m not going to get to gameweek four with Bernie away for Liverpool and be frustrated that I&#39;ve kept Berts. So if I sell him this week to like Cudas against Bournemouth at home or Semeno against Spurs away or Sar against Aston Villa away, are those players capable of outscoring Vertz this week? Probably yes. But there is a chance gets something and then he&#39;s got good fixtures afterwards. So if Palmer&#39;s out, there is no way I will sell Verts. If Palmer&#39;s fit, I&#39;ll think about it, but I suspect I will roll the transfer instead. with Cole Palmer. I&#39;m at a place right now where if he&#39;s missing game week three, even if he&#39;s back for gameweek four, I&#39;m probably going to sell him. I&#39;m just going to use this opportunity to use my two free transfers, spread the money around, relegate Jubury Hall to an eighth attacker instead, and just have a better overall squad. I&#39;ve thought about this quite a lot. I could just play Yoky Anderson instead, but that just feels so passive. And I get the, you know, point that people will make that information after the international break is going to be really key. I get that. I wish I had two or three uh transfers after the break. If Palm is out, that is so much of my budget not being used and I&#39;ve got those two free transfers. I didn&#39;t kneejerk after gameweek one. So, I&#39;m probably going to sell him. Let&#39;s get into who for right. And there&#39;s a lot to go through here. So, I&#39;ve got two choices. is I either sell Palmer in one move and just play Jubury Hall against Wolves away and have two free transfers in gameweek four or I use both of my moves and upgrade Gu to a better forward. I&#39;m pretty confident I will use two free transfers. So option one, the one move strategy is just Palmer to Kuna and get another Man United player in against Bernie at home. But I&#39;ll be honest, as much as that gives me an extra transfer in gameweek four, I just don&#39;t think I can bring in another Man United player. I&#39;m I&#39;m almost broken with Fernandez as it is. I just cannot add another one. I think we will beat Burnley, but there&#39;s just too much going on there that&#39;s just bad. So, I I don&#39;t think I will do that. I could just do Palmer to like S and roll the other transfer, but I think if I&#39;m going to get money in the bank, I want to use it straight away. So, option one is just to go straight to Kuna, have two attackers against Bernie at home. I don&#39;t see me doing it to be honest with you. Option two is Palmer to a 7.5 million or less midfielder and then Gu who&#39;s obviously third bench most weeks to a 7.5 millionish forward. So someone like Xiao Pedro Mateta Chris Wood Pedro and Met sorry Xiaro and Chris Wood have gone up in price. So if I want to get them the midfielder has to be Semeno or lower. Basically it would give me better squad depth because Juh Hall would become an eighth attacker. I wouldn&#39;t have to play him every week. And it also helps my bench boost options as well, which I&#39;ll talk about later. Maybe game week five is when I could use it. Option three is to do Palmer to a 6 million or less midfielder and then do Guillu straight up to York or Echitique. Now York long term I think is a really good pick, but it does feel bad buying him before Liverpool away. That basically feels like making a transfer now that I really don&#39;t want to make until seven or eight. But it is a possibility. I just bypass Wood Jiao Pedro and Mateta and go straight to the player that most people are going to want from gameweek seven and just have a Yorkesh and Watkins, you know, front line along with um Strand Len. So that&#39;s something that I could do. The thing that&#39;s playing on my mind with option three is I&#39;ve got Watkins sat there. So after Watkins finishes his good fixtures in gameweek seven, that&#39;s just a straight swap to York. So I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;ll do option three. I think right now option two is the most likely, but three is in the back of my mind. In terms of the players that I will go for, I do like Smenia, but that would only leave me 0.3 million for future upgrades. So my preferred option right now is Sar at Crystal Palace, 6.5 million. It would also if I sell Palmer and get Crystal Palace players, it would pretty much lock me in to free hit six because Crystal Palace play Liverpool that week. So I can bring in S for Aston Villa away this week, Sunderland at home next week and in game week six when they got their worst fixture of the next kind of six to seven. I can free hit them out. Also that would give me money to get Munos for Nico Williams in gameweek four. So gameweek four, Nico Williams plays Arsenal. I can get Munoz who plays against um Sunderland instead. And although Nico Williams has got good fixtures in five and six, if I&#39;m freehitting, I can just pick him back up for gameweek six anyway. So the only fixture I&#39;d really be missing is Bernie away in gameweek five. And ultimately, I just rather have Mino in gameweek four. It&#39;s just much more attacking. So that&#39;s what I quite like about that option to get SAR is it also gives me about a million in the bank to make a defender upgrade as well. I could also just go Tielemans or Rinders and save more money but right now I&#39;m favoring getting Sar and then getting Mateta over Wood and Xiao Pedro. Now Chris Wood and Jiao Pedro are the two most popular picks. If Palmer was out for a long time then I probably would prefer Xiao Pedro but it doesn&#39;t seem that that&#39;s likely so I&#39;m probably going to ignore him. Chris Wood&#39;s great this week because it&#39;s West Ham at home, but then it&#39;s Arsenal away in four. Whereas for Meta, it&#39;s Villa away this week than Sunderland at home. So, the next two are better for Palace. And again, if I&#39;m going to lock myself into free hit six, which I think I will if I sell Palmer, I can get Chris Wood for that Sunderland at home fixture and I I get rid of Mateta for Liverpool at home. So, I think it just makes more sense for my team to pick up Mateta. So if you look at gameweek six, like I said, Liverpool at home, I can get rid of him and I can just get Chris Wood. And after Sunderland at home in gameweek six, Forest fixtures aren&#39;t very good. So I don&#39;t have him for Arsenal away. I can get him for the Sunderland fixture and then I just don&#39;t have him afterwards. I think Mateta is a better longerterm pick. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m looking at him. Or the other option to get York is Palmer to a six million or less midfielder. That would be Tiemans or Rinders. Probably Rinders. gets Shawresh in nice and early, but it just doesn&#39;t feel great against Liverpool away. And like I said, I&#39;ve already got Watkins in place. One other thing that&#39;s on my mind, and I know this section&#39;s going on for quite a while, is captaincy. If I sell Palmer, I&#39;m only leaving myself with Salah most weeks, but that doesn&#39;t feel like a massive problem because Salah is never injured. So gameweek four, I would captain him against Burnley away. Gameweek five, Palmer&#39;s Man United away, Harland&#39;s Arsenal away, Salah&#39;s Everton at home. So I think four and five Salah&#39;s the best pick anyway. Gameweek six, Harland is the best pick. And you can even argue that Palmer&#39;s maybe slightly better than Salah. I&#39;m probably going to free hit if I sell Palmer that week to get Harland in. So that&#39;s covered. Gameweek seven, Harland of the three between him, Salah, and Palmer is probably the best option against Brenford away. Salah&#39;s got Chelsea away. Palmer&#39;s got Liverpool at home. if I really wanted to put myself through it. Um, Bruno Fernandez has got Sunderland at home that week, so I could go for him again if there&#39;s any kind of better performances from United before then. Or, of course, Ollie Watkins has got Bernie at home. So, I would prefer in gameweek seven to captain Harland, but it&#39;s not a deal breaker if I don&#39;t have Palmer and I don&#39;t want to go for Salah because I&#39;ve got Fernandez and Watkins as options. And then gameweek eight, Salah&#39;s got Man United at home. That&#39;s probably just as good as Harland having Everton at home and Palmer&#39;s got Forest away. So basically what I&#39;m trying to say here is if I sell Palmer, I still think he&#39;s a really good pick, but there&#39;s no weeks where I&#39;m going to have a problem cap not captaining him or having him as a captain option is what I&#39;m trying to say until gameweek nine when he&#39;s got Sunderland at home. But by that point hopefully I&#39;ll have a few spare transfers and I&#39;ve still got quite a few expensive players in my team like Bruno, maybe even Verts carries through the whole way. Ollie Watkins, I&#39;ve got places to get money from to buy Palmer back. So, I just don&#39;t see Palmer as a huge issue until gameweek nine and every other week I can captain Salah apart from gameweek seven where I&#39;ve got Watkins and Fernandez or game week six where I&#39;m probably going to free hit. So, going back to the team, I don&#39;t really want to lose Palmer if he and if he&#39;s fit, I will probably roll. But if he&#39;s not, I think I&#39;m going to sell. Even if he&#39;s back in game week four, he&#39;s going to go and I think it will be to S and I will use that money to upgrade Guillu to Mateta and I will bench Jbury Hall. I hope that makes sense. But I&#39;ve thought about this quite a lot. So I wanted to go through all my thoughts. And then up front I&#39;ve got Ollie Watkins against Crystal Palace at home. Jorgen Strand Lson currently playing for Wolves against Everton at home, but we know Newcastle are trying to buy him. So I&#39;ll talk about that in a second. And then Mark Giri sat third on my bench. did start in the Carabal Cup midweek for Sunderland and scored and got minutes off the bench in gameweek two. So that&#39;s potentially promising moving forward. But until we see proper starts from him in the Premier League, he&#39;s just going to remain third on the bench. If I sell Palmer, I&#39;ll probably upgrade him. But if not, I&#39;m happy for him to be third bench most weeks. Not a massive problem in my eyes. Watkins people are frustrated with. He&#39;s blanked the first two game weeks basically like all my attackers that aren&#39;t called Salah. But I bought him in because of the fixtures. So, I&#39;m going to see those fixtures out. My current plan is to wild card around game weeks 12, 13. Watkins will probably be in my team for the first seven weeks because the fixtures are so good and I&#39;ll look to sell him gameweek eight onwards. So, no problems with him. Stran Lson&#39;s an interesting one. If he stays at Wolves, I think he&#39;s a really good value player for 6.5 or below. I don&#39;t think right now as it stands there&#39;s too many better options at that price point and below. If he moves to Newcastle, he potentially becomes even better value if he&#39;s first choice. I am not as convinced as everyone else that if he moves, he&#39;ll be first choice because either Isac staying, in which case Strand Lson&#39;s a backup, or if EAC goes, I think Newcastle will buy two forwards. I don&#39;t think Eddie How will trust Strand Lson first choice, Oscilla backup. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. I think he wants Oscillar as his third forward. And I can just see Newcastle making a couple of panic buys. If you get over a hundred million for EAC, you buy Strand Lson for 6065, you go spend the rest of the money on another forward. Now, it might be the other forward comes in and is the backup and Strand Lson&#39;s first choice, but it&#39;s not a guarantee. So, I would look at it right now, worst case scenario for me, for my team is Strand Lson gets sold late on Friday, let&#39;s say, to Newcastle. So, he doesn&#39;t play for Wolves, but he also doesn&#39;t play for Newcastle either. That wouldn&#39;t be great because then Yoki Anderson&#39;s coming off the bench for me. But I&#39;m willing to risk it because if he stays at Wolves, I like him. And if he goes to Newcastle and he&#39;s first choice, I also really like him. If he gets sold on Thursday, by the way, I think there is a chance he goes straight into the team. He&#39;s had a preseason. He started the first two matches for Wolves. He scored a couple of goals midweek in the Carabal Cup. The fitness is there and I don&#39;t think Eddie How trust Oscela. So if he goes early enough against Leads, we could see Barnes, Strand Len, and Elanga. I&#39;m not completely ruling it out. Either way, I just can&#39;t sell him. This is another reason to have two or three transfers after the break just for all this information from the transfer market and obviously international break injuries and stuff like that. But I just think if Palmer is out, I&#39;ve got to sell him and I&#39;ve just got to hope for the best with Stran Lson. Like I said, worst case is he doesn&#39;t play this weekend, Yoki Manderson off the bench and then I go into gameweek four and he&#39;s not first choice and I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s going to start. But in that case, I&#39;ve got the money from buying SR to upgrade Strand Lson to like an Evan Nilson, who I&#39;m not I think he&#39;s a good pick. I&#39;m not massively worried about, but there&#39;s there&#39;s an option there to move Strand Lson on. Also, by the way, just to get all these thoughts out, if I go for Sara Mateta, that leaves me a million in the bank. I could just ignore Munos and all of a sudden I could do Strand Lson up to someone a bit more expensive. Maybe make a second move and get to Chris Wood, Jab Pedro, or someone like that. So, I still feel like I&#39;ve got options. ultimately with Strand I&#39;ve got to keep him. There is value there, but there is a worst case scenario for my team where it just doesn&#39;t go right. But hopefully he goes to Newcastle when he&#39;s first choice and plays leads this weekend because that would be um a nice stroke of luck. So that&#39;s my thoughts on transfers and stuff like that. I just want to show you how those moves for Cole Palmer would play out over the next few weeks. So this is the team I&#39;ve just spoken about in the my team tour over on Fantasy Football Hub. If you&#39;re going to sell a player like Cole Palmer, you better make sure your team looks good over the next few weeks. So using a tool like this is super handy and there&#39;s 50% off at the moment if you want to check it out. Link in the description below or scan the QR code on screen. If I just quickly check my AI suggested transfers, I&#39;m pretty confident. Yeah, it still wants me to do Mark Gu up to Mateta. I really like that upgrade to fund it. It wants me to do Palmer to Semeno. And I do like Semen at 7.2, but it only leaves me 3 million in the bank. And I just think for future upgrades, I want a bit more than that. That&#39;s why I&#39;m currently favoring Sar over Semeno. And also, I haven&#39;t told the tool that I&#39;m probably going to free hit in gameweek six. So, that might change the recommendations. It is interesting though that it&#39;s recommending Mateta over Wood and Xiao Pedro because I think most people prefer the other two. But, I like Mateta, especially if you&#39;re freehitting gameweek six. So, I&#39;m going to go back to the original team. I&#39;m going to put it on one gameweek only and I&#39;m going to sell Palmer and I&#39;m going to put Sar instead. And I&#39;m going to sell Mark Guillu and I&#39;m going to put in Mateta. So for gameweek three specifically, if I make those moves, I would then obviously bench Jbury Hall. So the squad looks better overall. I&#39;ve still got verts, but look, it is what it is. Gameweek four, I would then probably sell Nico Williams to Mino because he&#39;s got really nice fixtures and obviously he&#39;s much better for gameweek four. And I don&#39;t need Nico Williams for gameweek six because I&#39;m going to free. So, I&#39;m just going to make that transfer, save it, and optimize it again. All of a sudden then for gameweek four, it&#39;s Sanchez Brenford away, horror West Hamway, Anderson leads at home, Minor Sunderland at home. My midfield is Salarin Vvers Burnley away. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. If I don&#39;t sell verts this week, I&#39;m not going to get to gameweek four and be worried about him. Sar Sunderland at home, Fernandez City away. Jubury Hall they&#39;ve put in for Aston Villa at home, but I would play Strand Larson probably. And then Mateta&#39;s also Sunderland at home. So, Triple Palace against Sunderland and then Watkins against Everton away. That looks pretty good. Gameweek five, I would consider probably using my bench boost that week because my bench would probably be something like Sanchez against Man United away, Haro against Brighton away, Jbury Hall against Liverpool away, which is not great, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to get a better bench over the next few weeks, and then a Stev against Forest at home. And I kind of want to use my bench before I wild card. And I think this will be my best opportunity. I&#39;m not going to go through every single week in full, but basically if I optimize the team each week and you look at the bench, there&#39;s no gameweek where it&#39;s better than gameweek five. I would say like gameweek seven for example, you&#39;ve got like a stevka against Villa away. Gameweek eight is probably where it looks best. But again, Juice Hall is still playing Man City away. Y Madison&#39;s got Arsenal at home. So it&#39;s not better than game week, sorry, it&#39;s not miles better than gameweek five. So I think gameweek five if I sell Palmer I&#39;m going to bench boost and I&#39;m going to free hit in gameweek six and then from gameweek seven onwards I just worry about it then. So although it&#39;s not perfect I&#39;m having to carry Vertz and Fernandez through for quite a while. There is one reason I like that with my squad structure. I don&#39;t have much money in defense and I&#39;m not particularly worried about that until gameweek seven where I might want to go and get like Gabrielle from Arsenal. But because I&#39;ve got Munos and para money in the bank, I&#39;ve got the opportunity to do that. And also if I want to get like your crush in straight swap from Watkins in gameweek eight and if I want to get Palmer back, I&#39;ve got Vert and Fernandez. So Fernandez up to Palmer 1.5 million needed. that&#39;s verts down to I don&#39;t know like a 6.5 million midfielder or something like that. So I just feel like Palmer out just gives me so many options later on. This obviously relies on nothing going badly, no injuries and stuff like that, but you can&#39;t constantly worry about that. So I just think gameweek three and four look much better. Gameweek five gives me the opportunity to bench boost. Like Fernandez against Chelsea at home, Verts against Everton at home is fine. Game week six I would free hit and then game week seven I&#39;d have two free transfers to start messing about but even in gameweek seven the team looks okay against Everton away against leads away against Brighton at home Fernandez if I&#39;ve kept in that long has got Sunderland at home like Watkins Bernie at home like it looks fine so I&#39;m pretty keen on selling Palmer in fact I&#39;ve thought about this so much that if Moresca says Palmer&#39;s fit for gameweek three having to roll will feel pretty bad but that is probably what I&#39;ll do anyway that&#39;s my plans.
