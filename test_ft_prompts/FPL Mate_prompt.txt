TRANSCRIPT:
With Palmer injured, players out of form, I think it's time to make some transfers. This is how I'm going to be lining up for FPL gameweek 3. [Music] Welcome to FPL, mate. And first of all, welcome to my gameweek 2 scores. 50 points for me, which gave me a small green arrow. I guess it's not the worst in the world. It certainly wasn't a disaster game week or anything like that for me, but I was probably mostly bailed out by the Joel Pedro 15pointer, which maybe I got a little bit fortunate with there, but we absolutely take the luck wherever it comes because the rest of the team was not delivering the luck. Bruno with the missed penalty there. Obviously, both Marillo and Richards lost their clean sheets against each other. And oh god, Palmer an injury unavailable for that gameweek 2 fixture. He could have been on for a big score had he played, but unfortunately he unfortunately it was just not to be. But there still are some positives in my team. It's just not in the Aston Villa department. Rogers and Watkins just failing to deliver once again. Hopefully they can start to turn things around from gameweek 3 because I am quickly losing patience on these guys and I'm ready to make some transfers. And by the way guys, if you haven't checked out Fantasy Football Hub and become a member yet, what are you waiting for? They're still running 50% off.

So, it's a no-brainer. you either win your mini league or you you get Fantasy Football Hub for free for the year. So, uh yeah, really easy decision there, guys. Link in the description to claim that deal. Let's move on to my gameweek three team and we're going to start off with Sanchez, Bobby Sanchez in goal. And so far, I think so good. Really got a couple of safe points so far there. And really the only goal that Chelsea have conceded so far this season was that Pakqueta wonder goal in gameweek 2. Chelsea actually have a 39% chance of a clean sheet in this gameweek according to the market odds which is actually pretty nice there really. So I'm happy to go again with Sanchez. I think he has he's turning out to be a pretty solid uh goalkeeper pick and I think maybe another clean sheet against Fulham could be on the cards. Let's go into defense with Pedro Porro. Another player who I think has been one of the stronger players so far this season. Spurs are finally a good defense again so it would seem. and three shots and five key passes so far this season for Pedro Porro. That's actually better than Florian Vitz. He's a set piece taker as we know. So hopefully we can start to see his shots, his key passes, his set pieces turn into some attacking returns against Bournemouth this week. Um Bournemouth also do have a slight bias for chances conceded from the right hand side which is going to favor the likes of Pedro Porro and indeed Kudus if you have him in your squad. Our next defender is Murio Forest have been a little unlucky with no clean sheets yet. 1.8 expected goals conceded so far in total this season which is the same as Arsenal and Chelsea for reference. So really good defensive numbers just failing to get those clean sheets over the line so far. Maybe been a bit unfortunate with you know late goal conceded in gameweek one just the one goal conceded to Crystal Palace in gameweek two. Um so a little disappointing there. Also, Murio kind of disappointing for defensive contributions as well. Just 11 so far in in two matches, which is far below kind of what we saw last season. So, I'm hoping things can get back to normal a little bit with Mario this week against West Ham at home. It's a great fixture. You're going to get great chances of a clean sheet here if you are on Forest Defenders. I just want to see some defcon as well from him. And our final defender is going to be Riches. Now, this is a really tough one for me because I have Watkins and Rogers for Aston Villa in my squad. So, I'm really conflicted here. Do I want to play Richards as a defender against two of my Aston Villa attackers? It doesn't really make sense, does it? But according to the market odds, despite being a great defense so far, Palace, they only have a 21% chance of a clean sheet this week. Now, this might be impacted by the tired legs from their European qualifier in the midweek. Uh that was that's play that was played on Thursday evening. But also Aston Villa have failed to score a single goal so far this season and every center back who has played against Aston Villa so far this season has come away with defensive contribution points which is a really interesting fact. And my alternative is to play Jof who plays for West Ham against Nottingham Forest and and that really was the original plan to play Jof against Nottingham Forest but West Ham have been so bad I don't know if I can bring myself to do it. So maybe this one goes down to the wire, but I think I'm going to hedge towards what Richards on this one just to hedge my bets a little bit against the Aston Villa defense. We'll maybe come back to this and speak a little bit on JF when we come to my bench. But first of all, let's move on to my midfield. We've got Mo Salah. Disappointing performance again in gameweek 2, but still managing to come away with FPL points. That's just what he does. Uh Salah's individual record against Arsenal is actually quite good. He has faced Arsenal five times in the past three seasons and scored three times during that time which is not too bad. Um this isn't typically a lowscoring game between Arsenal and Liverpool. We often see you know score draws kind of thing from these games. Um, but I don't know, you would imagine Arsenal would probably want to put a stop to that. Um, keep the score line low. And if Liverpool's goals are spread around among more players, as they seem to be this season, you would imagine that impacts kind of reduces Salah's appeal in a week like this. But at the same time, it's Salah, so you know, it can go either way, can't it? But yeah, I I think it looks unlikely that Salah will get a return against Arsenal, but at the same time, it's looked unlikely he would get a return in the first two games, uh, having watched the games and yet he's still done it. It's just what he does. We got Palmer here still. Uh, he's predicted by a lot of people to be rested this week against Fulham. Uh, maybe that changes after press conferences, but Moresca doesn't usually tell us too much, so I wouldn't be uh expecting definitive information there. But given that my current plan is to free hit in gameweek six when Palmer has his best fixture, our best upcoming fixture that's going to be against Brighton, I'm actually pretty comfortable with selling him and freehitting him back in gameweek six. And selling him is also going to be quite nice for trying to plan out a bench boost as well. Free up some budget, reinvest in some areas, make some upgrades throughout my team, and get ready for a bench boost. Uh, and then we can sort of wild card after that. So, I think I'm I'm I'm maybe more comfortable than most to sell Palmer. Uh I definitely understand if people want to keep him, but you know, he didn't exactly perform in gameweek one either. He costs a lot of money if he's not likely to play this weekend and I can free hit him back in in gameweek six anyway. Maybe it just makes sense to sell try and pick up a player I'm a little more confident in. We've got Bruno Fernandez up next. And yeah, here we go. I could speak a lot on Bruno and Manchester United, but we'll try and keep things as brief as as possible. Uh, yes, of course, United drew to Grimby and then lost on penalties in the League Cup during the week. But shocking results happen all the time in the cups. That's why we love the cups, especially when key players are rested and when individuals are making big mistakes, as we saw with uh, you know, I don't want to name names, but players for Manchester United in that game. And I think things can go either way after something like this. Um either heads are down, everyone has given up already. It seems a little bit strange this early in the season, but you know, it's possible. The other way you can look at it from a mentality point of view is the team will be fired up to bounce back. And different people will have their different opinions on that one. I'm not going to tell you which one's right and which one's wrong because we don't know yet until we see Manchester United go up against Burnley. But what I will say is the book makers still have United as heavy favorites in this game. They have great goalc scoring odds, great clean sheet odds, um among the top, depending on what markets you look at, sometimes the best uh goal scoring and clean sheet odds in the entire Premier League for gameweek three. So that's despite everything that's happened with Grimby. And you know, we've got some great opt like opportunities here to kind of bet against maybe the crowd who are going to be like Man United like Drew to Grimby. They are obviously a League 2 team. They're going to be terrible for the rest of football history and there's no way we can bounce back. They can bounce back. And you know, to to play against those people, you know, I'm I'm kind of happy to do that because the bookmakers like this one. They they give uh Bruno, for example, a 0.38 projected goals for gameweek 3, for example, which is really good. add in the assists and you're probably odds on for an attacking return. You're going to get defensive contributions there as well. Um, you know, these people are getting paid to predict the results. You know, unlike, you know, people having a laugh at Manchester United on social media. Totally get it. It is definitely funny as a non-Man United fan. But in FPL, I don't really care about what's funny. I care about what what gets me the FPL points. And, you know, things still do still suggest that Manchester United players can get some points this week. Um, so yeah, let's get serious. Bruno is still a great player to own in this fixture in isolation. A full strength Man United team playing against a far easier team than Arsenal or Fulham. People are talking about keeping Vitz for his game against Burnley in gameweek four. But Bruno has offered more in attack in open play attack uh and in defensive contributions than Vertz so far this season. Plus, he has penalties, plus he has all the set pieces. Well, not all, but you know, a lot of set pieces. It's a nobrainer to keep Bruno. And I think he's still a potential captain. Um, yeah, come at me. I'm sorry. Let's like, it's funny to laugh at Man United, but at the end of the day, Bruno is not suddenly just going to, you know, be a terrible football player. And I think a lot of the people who are saying, you know, Bruno is just a defensive midfielder now. I think that is pretty lazy analysis. And if you actually watch watch the games, Bruno is still creating. He's still taking shots. If you kind of look at the stats, that that proves it as well. Um, so yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy to continue on. But let's move on because we can spend way too much time on Manchester United. Maybe that's for another time. We got Morgan Rogers. He has shown absolutely nothing of positivity this season. Something needs to change at Aston Villa. I do still trust Rogers will bounce back eventually, but I don't know when that will be. Could it be against a tired Palace team at home this weekend? I hope so because I I can't stay patient forever on this one. But there's some nice fixtures coming up. I don't have the assist odds yet. But the markets have Rogers at 0.28 projected goals, which could be a lot worse. That's not too bad really. So, I think I'd probably have to hold on to Rogers for now. We'll give him one more chance because we know he's a brilliant football player. It would just be nice if uh you know, he he showed it again this season. Um it's going to happen eventually hopefully this week. We got Jbury Hall much better in gameweek two actually. Three key passes, one big chance created. Being on corners and remaining in that attacking midfield position despite the signing of Jack Greish does give him some nice assist potential, particularly against a weaker Wolves side. He also had a nice rest in the midweek cup game. I do worry about this pick as a regular starter in my FPL team over the longer term, particularly as he has yet to take a single shot and that's a big part of where you get your points from your midfielders. So, you know, something to consider going forwards, but I think that he's absolutely fine for gameweek three. Again, in isolation, particularly at this crazy 5 million price tag, it is a bargain, but I think I will be looking to upgrade this position in the near future. And part of that might come through selling the likes of Cole Palmer. Let's look at Watkins. Very poor in gameweek one, improved though in gameweek two, I will say. Four shots all in the box and accumulating a healthy 0.37 xG in that fixture. He also made one key pass against Brenford there as well. But again, we're relying on Palace being tired because generally they are a very good defense. We're relying on Aston Villa to play more attacking and you know actually score their first goal of the season. If they do score their first goal of the season in gameweek three, you know, odds on it is going to be Watkins there. Um you would imagine that Aston Villa will set up to be more attacking which hopefully can benefit Watkins and Rogers and maybe even benefit some Crystal Palace attackers too if this is a slightly higher scoring game. But uh let's talk about the hero of gameweek 2. Joel Pedro saved my gameweek last week. Maybe a bit fortunate uh to get as many returns as he did. But we will take the luck where we can get it. If Palmer is out, that makes him a better pick because he will play behind the striker. And even before Palmer pulled out of game week, he was still starting uh at the same time as Dilap, which I thought was quite interesting. So I think we've seen a real boost to Jo Pedro's minutes potential and uh I think he's going going forward he's going to be a really nice pick. And hey, if there is no Palmer up in gameweek three, he could be the penalty taker as well, which would be very, very nice indeed. So, I I think I'm really torn between Jo Pedro and Fernandez for captain this week. It's a really tough decision because I do think Fulham are a strong defense, but Chelsea are just on fire right now and particularly this guy. So, we'll come back to captaincy in a moment. Let's look at the bench quickly first though. Dravka, as much as uh we're all down on Man United right now, I don't expect Burnley to keep a clean sheet this week. Both Dravka and Estve will remain on my bench. Mark Gu started in the League Cup, but um probably wasn't the greatest overall performance, but he did score the goal in in that game. I don't think he's quite ready for a Premier League start, so he can also stay on the bench. And we got Jof. This is the tough one. This is the tough one. So, since I have that double villa attack and no forest attackers, do I just play Jof and hope for the best? West Ham just looks so poor right now. I'm not sure if I can do it. Then you have the attacking threat from Jof, but I have Marillo anyway, so it's not like I want Jof to score or an assist. Um, Palace have that that those clean sheet odds of 21% as we mentioned. West Ham have odds of 19%. So there's actually not too much in it, but I like Richards more as a pick generally right now. And I think I'm going to pick based on form here uh rather than anything else. And Richard is a guy in form, which means J on the bench means I'm hedging against my Aston Villa defenders. Maybe Richards can get Defcon points and if so, maybe that softens the blow if Aston Villa attackers were to do very well. I mean, it's kind of win-win, but also maybe kind of lose-lose for me. I guess we'll see. So, let's talk about transfers, guys. So, with the plan still in place to free hit in gameweek six, I'm happy to make some transfers really. I'm happy to sell Palmer. If I downgrade Palmer, that also frees up some money so I can upgrade my bench ready for a potential gameweek 8 bench boost. That's what I'm looking at right now. It's the the game week in which Burnley play at home to lead United which could be a nice little opportunity to bench boost with the likes of Dravka, maybe Estv as uh players there. Um so yeah, thinking maybe something like that. Um I kind of think Gu could maybe go up to someone like Chris Wood. Jbury Hall could maybe be upgraded to, you know, maybe someone like like Barnes or someone like that. Maybe Semeno. Even taking juke to an Arsenal defender is possible in the near future or juke to minor maybe could could work for game week for next game week when Crystal Palace plays Sunderland. But right now, this is the transfer I like the most and this is the one I feel good about. So, is Mila Sar Palmer Isa, we know he had the best underlying stats last season for his price tag. He already scored for the first time this season against Forest. So, he's off the mark in terms of that goalcoring form. Obviously uh you great performance goal scoring against Liverpool in the Community Shield as well. Uh Villa will play in attack which might make them more open to counters. They're already fairly open to counterattacking and they do have a weakness on their left side which Sar will be attacking on their on Crystal Palace's right side. A really nice matchup here in particular. Sar has a proven record against Villa. Seven goals, three assists in six starts throughout his career. He's never blanked against Villa and even after that game uh we see Sar face Sunderland and then West Ham. Then we got gameweek six against Liverpool. I can free hit S out for that fixture. No problem. And then we have Everton and Bournemouth. So again, pretty nice fixtures there. So yeah, he's been a bit of a bit of a troll player in the past, but I think I'm I'm I'm finally ready to get hurt again. I'm I'm I'm ready. Uh no, I feel good about this pick. I could maybe use my second transfer here as well. Plenty of money in the bank. We could do Mark Gu for Wood, Jbury Hall for Barnes. And although I think they they would be great moves for gameweek three. They do feel a little luxurious. I don't think I I really need these players and also I don't think they really help my team in the longer term either. Wood has his best fixture in the week that I'm going to free hit him in anyway. And Barnes will probably be out of the Newcastle starting 11 by gameweek six or seven. So, I would love to have two free transfers for the international break and the end of the transfer window as well, of course. So, right now, I think I'm just going to go for the one transfer. I am tempted to hunt those short-term gains if you like and use that second transfer, but I don't think I need to really. It would probably mean dropping Jbury Hall or maybe Rogers, but again, would I feel super happy about dropping those players? I don't think I need to. And I think there's potential for me to get punished there as well. um particularly using a transfer maybe on a player that I'll probably need to remove again. So maybe it's a kind of a two transfer move in many ways. So yeah, not sure. Not sure. Think I'm happy with the one transfer, but maybe I'm open to a second one. Let's look at captains, guys. I'll start off by saying if I had Erling Harland in my team, I would absolutely captain him, but I don't. Uh I really don't fancy Salah in this game, particularly against Arsenal. So it's a good time to punt. I think a good time to go for someone different. For the purpose of this video, I am going to put the captain's armband on Joel Pedro because I'm insecure and I need approval and I don't think I can face the comments section where I to put the armband on Bruno. But look, come on. Bruno is getting the vice captain. So, go ahead and roast me for that if you need to. I am genuinely really stuck between these two players. Um, if Palmer is confirmed out, I'll probably stick with Joel Pedro. But if there's kind of any indication that that Palmer is likely to be back and start in this game, that might push me towards Bruno Fernandez. If there's no information, maybe we stay with Joel Pedro. But look, I I I like both. I think they're both solid captain picks this week. They both have really good projections. The models back them, the markets back them. I like them both. But right now, it is form over fixture. Let's see what happens. So, that is what we're looking at right now, but we got some plans going forward, guys. So, we are indeed on the Fantasy Football Hub My Team tour, and we're going to check out what uh what the what the the AI, the algorithm thinks of my team, pretty much. And uh yeah, I love using this tool to try and get a second opinion if I'm split between two players for for a certain decision, like what should I do? I think my biggest headache this week is Riches versus Duke. And lo and behold, both of them are predicted 3.5 points. And I guess that's not too bad for points projections for a 4.5 million defender, but at the same time, it's like that doesn't help with my decision one bit. They've got equal. So yeah, guys, I'm I'm interested, you know, are you guys seeing similar things? Are you having are you are you at least getting a little bit more guidance from from the from the hub? Hopefully, because usually you do, but sometimes, you know, you get a bit of bad luck. And they both had the same predicted points. So yeah, I guess we continue on with Richards. In terms of the points projections, Salah and Bruno are ahead of Joel Pedro, but I don't think the minutes potential has quite been adjusted for Joel Pedro yet. So I think we do need to factor that in as well as penalty share because like I said, I think Palmer being out does have a real nice impact on Joel Pedro. And I think we are going to see his predictive points grow and grow as kind of these models kind of adjust to uh to to the new information of how how things are setting up for Chelsea and the form of the the team generally as well. Rogers has taken a bit of a dive s not really fancied against Aston Villa but look the record speaks for itself in this particular fixture. That would leave me with two free transfers. And going into gameweek four I think one issue I have is is again with the defense. I'm not going to play a stev against Liverpool. I'm not going to play Milo against Arsenal. I don't really want to play Jof against Spurs. So, it might be that next week I need to make a defender transfer. So, it'll either be I have a Melo out. So, remember against Sunderland in gameweek six, I am going to be free hitting in forest players. So, I don't need Merillo for Sunderland, but maybe we could maybe we won for Burnley in gameweek five. So, I'm thinking one of Merillo or Duth out for either Munoz or an Arsenal defender. And I haven't really decided which one it's going to be yet. Let's let's just let's just say for argument sake it's Mos and then we have Richards and Moz and S against Sunderland at home and I think that's pretty nice really. So it could be Moz we could go for maybe Gabrielle Ciba not quite sure yet. Um, a good thing about, you know, the Arsenal defenders for me is, yes, we will have an Arsenal defender against City, but since I'm free hitting in gameweek six, I skip the Newcastle game, which means really, if we look at all of the fixtures for Arsenal coming up, it's really only Man City. It's the only rough fixture there. We'll have Forest at home, we'll have West Ham, we'll have Newcast, we'll have Fulham, we'll have Crystal Palace there. So, actually, it's a it's a pretty nice run for for Gabrielle generally. And actually from gamew week four, if I go for him then and free hit in six, I'm actually taking all of the weeks in which Gabrielle has the best projected points and the the week in which he has the lowest projected points is the week I won't have him. So um yeah, that that could potentially work. I'm a little on the fence there whether I go for Gabrielle or I go for Munoz. I think Munoz is a little more exciting, but Gabrielle is maybe a little more sensible long-term, a little bit more expensive as well, of course. So yeah, maybe leaning towards Mos. both work and it's great that you know if I can carry two free transfers into gameweek four I've got some time to think about that I've got some time to consider it and you know I'll even have that additional transfer to maybe do something else can we make the Jbury Hall upgrade can we make the Mark Q upgrade what kind of players might we be looking at to try and just improve this team a little bit more but I think in gameweek four when I kind of look forward to what I think I'm going to need it's it's it's going to be one more defender um to go alongside Richards and Pedro Porro And it's going to be probably one more midfielder as well to to go in ahead of Juicebury Hall because I'm not super confident about Ju Hall. So I think saving the extra transfer, we could go Chris Wood this week. Um maybe it's worth saving the transfer. I'm not sure. But planning it out. I you know I've spent a lot of time on hub this week trying to plan things out, look at different eventualities. So definitely always recommend this tool.
