TRANSCRIPT:
Here is my FPL gameweek 3 team selection with two free transfers and injured Cole Palmer and I plan on using both if he&#39;s definitely ruled out. In goal I&#39;ve got Sanchez of Chelsea who&#39;ve been good defensively at home to Fulham. Pedro Poru is in. We&#39;ve got Agadoo against Everton and Williams of Nottingham Forester against West Ham. Three home defenders with some good fixtures. Into midfield I plan on making my first transfer here and downgrading Cole Palmer to Saw of Crystal Palace. However, he will be on my bench as he goes away to Aston Villa this week. Again, I haven&#39;t actually confirmed my transfers, but this is my current plan if Palmer is ruled out. We&#39;ve got MoSalah in there, Bruno Fernan, who&#39;s currently got the Camaran ban. I&#39;m giving Morgan Rogers one more week and hopefully Rinders gets back into the attacking returns. Up front, I&#39;ve got Jao Pedro and Ollie Watkins still, but the last transfer I plan is upgrading Mark Guillu to Chris Wood. This would give me a better squad depth. We would have strong first sub if any injuries came. Current plan with two free transfers is Saw and Chris Woodin with Bruno Fernandez as my potential captain despite losing to Grimby.

IMPORTANT:
- The transcript may have transcription errors for player names
- Use the top players list to identify correct player names and their injury status
- ALL PLAYER NAMES must include position in format: "Player (POS)" e.g. "Salah (FWD)", "Robertson (DEF)"
- Extract their actual team selection, transfers, and reasoning
- Formation: Look for tactical discussions (3-5-2, 4-4-2, etc.) - set null if not mentioned
- Key Issues: Extract major talking points with their specific opinions (if any discussed)
- Watchlist: Players they mention considering but not immediately transferring (high/med/low priority)
- Bank ITB: If they mention money in the bank or ITB, capture the amount (e.g. "0.5m", "2.1m")
- Consider player availability (status/news/chance_of_playing_next_round) in analysis
- Set confidence based on clarity of their decisions and transcript length
- If information is unclear or missing, use empty arrays for lists and default values
- FOR SHORT TRANSCRIPTS (<3000 chars): Focus on extracting the most essential information (transfers, captain)
- ALWAYS return valid JSON even if limited information is available
