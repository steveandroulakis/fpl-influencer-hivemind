## 3) My Team vs Influencers (Gap Analysis)

**My Current XI**: Dúbravka (GKP), Wan-Bissaka (DEF), Estève (DEF), Van de Ven (DEF), Kudus (MID), Wirtz (MID), Ndiaye (MID), M.Salah (MID-C), Marc Guiu (FWD), João Pedro (FWD), Gyökeres (FWD)
**My Bench**: Kelleher, Palmer (VC), Frimpong, Konsa

**Critical Gap - Missing Universal Captain**:
• **B.Fernandes NOT IN SQUAD** - All influencers captaining him vs Burnley (H). This is PRIORITY #1!

**Players I have being benched/sold**:
• **Palmer** - Universal sell due to injury (All influencers)
• **Marc Guiu** - Being upgraded by multiple (Let's Talk FPL, FPL Harry)
• **Wirtz** - Underperforming but hold recommended (FPL Raptor, Let's Talk FPL)

**Popular picks I'm missing (by PRIORITY)**:
1. **B.Fernandes** - Universal captain choice, not in squad!
2. **Sánchez/Raya** - Premium GK options (FPL Raptor, FPL Mate, Let's Talk FPL, FPL Focal, FPL Harry)
3. **Pedro Porro** - Majority defensive pick (FPL Raptor, FPL Mate, Let's Talk FPL, FPL Harry)
4. **Wood** - Popular forward option with great fixtures (Multiple backers)

| Slot | My Player | Influencer View | Risk/Reason | Suggested Alt | Backers |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| MID | Palmer (bench) | Sell immediately | 0% playing chance | Sarr/Semenyo | All |
| MID | Missing Bruno | Universal captain | Not owning captain choice | B.Fernandes | All |
| FWD | Marc Guiu | Upgrade needed | Poor returns | Wood/Mateta | Let's Talk FPL, FPL Harry |
| GKP | Dúbravka | Budget option | Missing CS potential | Sánchez | Majority |

**Money & constraints**: £0.5m ITB, 2 FTs available, Palmer injury forces one transfer

## 4) Action Plan (This GW + Short-Term)

### CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION
**You MUST bring in B.Fernandes** - He's the universal captain choice this week and you don't own him!

### Recommended Path (2FT Available)
**Option A - Priority Captain Fix**:
1. Palmer → B.Fernandes (£10.5m → £9.0m, +£1.5m)
2. Marc Guiu → Wood (£4.5m → £7.7m, -£3.2m)
• New ITB: £0.3m (estimate)
• Captain: B.Fernandes, Vice: M.Salah

**Option B - Squad Balance**:
1. Palmer → Sarr (£10.5m → £6.5m, +£4.0m)
2. Ndiaye → B.Fernandes (£6.5m → £9.0m, -£2.5m)
• New ITB: £2.0m (estimate)
• Captain: B.Fernandes, Vice: M.Salah

### Transfers

**With 2FT**:
- **Must do**: Palmer → midfielder (injury forced)
- **Must consider**: Getting B.Fernandes for captaincy
- Budget after Palmer sale: ~£11.0m available for midfielder
- If not getting Bruno directly, need Palmer → Sarr + upgrade elsewhere to Bruno

### Captain & Vice
- **Captain**: B.Fernandes (if owned) - SAFE
- **Alternative**: M.Salah - SAFE (if Bruno not acquired)
- **Vice**: M.Salah or João Pedro

### Starting XI & Bench Order
**If Option A taken**:
- GK: Dúbravka
- DEF: Van de Ven, Estève, Wan-Bissaka
- MID: M.Salah (C), B.Fernandes, Wirtz, Kudus, Ndiaye
- FWD: João Pedro, Wood
- Bench: Kelleher, Gyökeres (1), Frimpong (2), Konsa (3)

### Chips
No chip recommended - save for future doubles/blanks

### Future Planning (GW+1 to GW+3)
• **GW3**: Consider Muñoz for defensive upgrade (FPL Mate, Let's Talk FPL)
• **GW4-5**: Monitor Salah captaincy opportunities vs Burnley/Everton
• **GW6**: Potential free hit/wildcard week per multiple influencers
• Hold Wirtz through tough Arsenal fixture for better run after

**Key Warning**: Not owning B.Fernandes when he's universally captained could result in massive rank drop if he hauls vs Burnley!
